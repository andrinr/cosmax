Cosmax
======================

Fast and differentiable tools for analysis and inference on structured and unstructured data in cosmology.

The main contributions of this package are:

- Fast and fully differentiable Power Spectrum Computation. This can be used for optiziation with loss functions that depend on the power spectrum.
- Mapping unstructured particle distribution to 3D grids with differentiable mass assignment.
- Mapping from 3D grids to unstructured particle distributions with gradient-based optimization over mass assignment.
